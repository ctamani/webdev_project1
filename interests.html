    <h1>Welcome to My Interests Page</h1>
    <p>Here's a glimpse into some of my favorite things: my manga collection, my desk setup, and my cat.</p>

    <h2>My Manga Collection</h2>
    <p>I love collecting manga and watching anime! Some of my favorite series include One Piece, Solo Leveling, Tokyo Ghoul, Gangsta, Deadman Wonderland, and much more.</p>

    <h2>My Desk Setup</h2>
    <p>I've always wanted a well-organized and personalized desk setup, so I carefully picked out things I love, arranged everything neatly, and made it my ideal workspace.</p>
